a currency that spans across the globe and remains same in value  everywhere has a fundamental fallacy. There are economies that are doing  great,,,,
$MSTR still holds a lot more BTC and can still post more collateral from the rest of its BTC. For clarity.,,,,
1 Bitcoin is enough to cover the average rent in California.,,,,
2 years later and at the sunny year 2021 the ATH was close to $69K. The amazing Bitcoin had raised not by a tenfold but over 20 times from the heinous bear market. People were happy but also greedy. They wanted to it break $100K too fast and too early.   The bulls were tired and lasereyes sleepy.,,,,

I literally started this post saying that it's a controversial opinion you fucking idiots you think I made this post thinking that you guys will shower me with love?,,,,
I run Bitcoin Core.  That has a fully-downloaded transaction log.  Then,,,,
I see various problems for mass adoption. However if its possible to use another persons node I see how this can be scaled and easy to use.,,,,
I think it is important to consider what new users think when they are first beginning to use/hold BTC as well as what people think of the community from the outside. I guess I don't see many people pointing out the hypocrisy of some of these trusted large entities in the bitcoin and overall crypto system and how they directly contradict  many of the reasons bitcoin was created (and tbh resemble a lot of what I thought we were working to avoid in the current financial framework).,,,,
I think it may pique the interest of more retail investors as well as the institutions to say,,,,
I think it’s most important we find ways to provide clean,,,,
I thought I would see if and where I can use my Muun wallet as much as possible. I cant really use it in my country (New Zealand) very much yet - but can someone tell me if they have any experience of using it in stores/restaurants etc in the US?,,,,
I will be officially buying btc 1 day on Binance.US,,,,
"I would love some insight!\"",,,,
I'm sorry -- it's never too late to start over. For those of you considering it and not understanding what it is,,,,
