Bob has 7 dollars and Harry has 20 dollars to start with. And there is an apple in a room.,,,,
I sent bitcoin to the winners choice of charity,,,,
"5:01 AM\"\"",,,,
6 transactions were deposits to the address one was a withdrawal of like .0003 bitcoin ( I was testing if another address I own works because I’m paranoid whenever I make a new address).,,,,
Bitcoin came onto the scene,,,,
Bitcoin has performed incredibly well in the past,,1970-01-01T01:00:00.000+01:00,,
Bitcoin is the status quo. Everyone has a Bitcoin wallet (or LN wallet),,,,
Carpenter by trade,,,,
Fold won't accept my Strike account for funding.,,,,
I Guess no judge could take them from my ledger ans give them to her,,,,
I admire you. You can now start setting up a savings plan all the way down to whatever dollar value Bitcoin might go during the recession. On the way up,,,,
I can't connect to any channels AFAIK.,,,,
I can't help but be concerned about one thing: the privacy of the transactions.,,,,
I can't imagine that there will really be room for a large number of digital mediums of exchange in the future.,,,,
I decided to move the rest. In some way it looks like a leap of faith,,,,
I do not see anyone really discussing the danger of dropping below the cost to mine. If that happened,,,,
I do want to see all the Asset Managers,"Do not buy Bitcoin, yet!",,,
I don't mind too much leaving it on the exchange company,,,,
"I don’t know how exactly they will invest in this. I can’t get more details.\"",,,,
"I have gradual transition to being a BTC maxi because it did exactly what I wanted to do from the starting. \"\"Storing the value that I created with my skills\"\".",,,,
I have used CashApp when Coinbase was down during Coinbase outages (Seemed to always happen during market dips in the past),,,,
I have watched every rise and fall,,,,
I learned about the project. At the time,,,,
I quickly realised my stupid mistake.,,,,
"I sold a 2016 Ford Focus RS with a fully built Mountune high performance long block and EFR-7163 turbo!\"",,,,
I think it has exceeded that taking into account the split (so cap wise).,,,,
I think this is it.,,,,
I thought about it a bit. I seems to me that if I buy bitcoin,,,,
"I will update in 6 months.\"",,,,
I wouldn't mind hearing what your favorite platform is with purchasing Bitcoin. I have fractions of Bitcoin on multiple apps that I've never really seen the effort of grouping them together since they're such small amounts. With one big egg in the basket,,,,
I'd like to see some DeFi action _without_ speculation - I really would like more control over the money I actually own,,,,
If any of you have tried premium versions of these would really appreciate the feedback.,,,,
I’ve been contemplating two gameplans:,,,,
"Japan and Britain to US monetary and military hegemony.\"",,,,
Lighting Network will enable high power monopolies to dictate BTC transactions. Benevolent or not,,,,
MONEY,,,,
Mullvad VPN accepts BTC as a payment method.,,,,
NOT YOUR BITCOIN,,,,
Riot reserves the right to select from the pool of questions. Keep them reasonable and please remain cordial!,,,,
Silver,,,,
Steven &lt;steven.rando@.com&gt;,,,,
a Ledger Nano S for example is at least 4x more expensive comparing to Brazilian non-official sellers. This is making me think if is really that secure.,,,,
a bank safe deposit box,,,,
a person can just send some/all funds to another address and avoid the blacklisting of that address?,,,,
a span of 4 years (May 2018 - May 2022) and calculated with buying for $2 an hour.,,,,
all mafias,,,,
all they need to do is crack my pin to access my funds right? Since the live ledger app doesnt actually have anything related to access my funds and doesnt do anything except serve as a interface. correct?,,,,
and  an inescapable way of organizing human activity,,,,
and I connect it to another channel. I receive 5 bitcoins through those channels.,,,,
and also they will earn on it with taxes,,,,
and gambling,,,,
and have to convert my crypto into fiat to pay for those costs.,,,,
and more and more bitcoin hardcore fans abandon the network,,,,
and that will continue in perpetuity.,,,,
and through such moderate gastrointestinal irritation,,,,
and what you can access is at the discretion of the bank. This is mainly because the money has all but been stolen,,,,
"anyone who buys and holds will win\"\" is also something that's not guaranteed to happen. It's only true if more people keep putting more money into Bitcoin",,,,
as Bitcoin's value as pristine collateral increases. The risk of lending it out to 3rd parties who rehypothecate via risky fractional reserve lending tactics - inflating and manipulating the market by selling paper bitcoin whilst absorbing real world bitcoin demand,,,,
as I pay fees every time I convert crypto.,,,,
bear markets,,,,
because no one can predict what other sellers will do in an environment that is potentially being pumped by the massive purchases of a spot etf. But unless I'm missing something,,,,
bitcoin has a lot of utility as a currency. Probably isn't the easiest way to pay for a cup of coffee,,,,
but I don’t understand the idea of “go away market,,,,
but I need some advice as I don't want to mess anything up.,,,,
"but any ideas to make this system better would benefit everyone.\"",,,,
but for an S9J Miner on Newegg:,,,,
but it doesn’t let you buy or get paid in bitcoin like CashApp and Strike.,,,,
but its hitting $18K almost now.,,,,
but keep Bitcoin Core running at all times.,,,,
but my mining rigs are still working hard even can earn a little.,,,,
but not anonimous. Take this into account when making transactions,,,,
but now I'm found.,,,,
but to just better understand the pros and cons of every argument. And of course,,,,
buy about .20 BTC,,,,
can or may Blockchain took over my wallet?,,,,
certirus paribus. Of course,,,,
come out of nowhere from an anonymous person,,,,
conferences,,,,
could Bitcoin survive this information being made public knowledge? If true,,,,
deeply research seed phrase security. Find out what works for you. At a bare minimum,,,,
do they need to only use Bluewallet to gain access to the BTC or would it work with other wallets that follow the same protocol?,,,,
don’t buy into it. This won’t crush crypto. If anything,,,,
electricity and the profitability is mainly given by price,,1970-01-01T01:00:00.000+01:00,,
especially with all the btc maxi’s that are blinded by their vision for any counter-arguments.,,,,
even more than the regular budget.,,,,
even ones at odds,,,,
everything is a great investment haha a bottle of cooking oil has 12x in last 30 days,,,,
except to say that it’s overall been a good read,,,,

fiat is not. You dont own any money,,,,
fixed cost and labor etc.  20BTC/ year. 4 BTC profit yay!,,,,
for example the Tor DDoS attack.,,,,

get it off any exchange or website NOW. Don’t leave it on Coinbase,,,,
good on you,,,,
"he will say \"\"ah",in which the LN would not immediately collapse.,,,
highlight with your highlighter each letter (again,,,,
hoping we eventually go back to 17K levels before reaching my liquidation price,,,,
how will miners be rewarded for their effort to contribute to the blockchain?,,,,
however just excluding that best we can,,,,
i **KNOW it already exists**,,,,
i tried to use “CryptoWatch - Desktop Tracker”,,,,
if not for that pesky key function: hold its value. This point is non debatable,,,,
if yes - which?,,,,
if you do a TA on the trends,,,,
if you like it and want to tip me. That would encourage me to write more from my understanding and earn sats: LNURL1DP68GURN8GHJ7AMPD3KX2AR0VEEKZAR0WD5XJTNRDAKJ7TNHV4KXCTTTDEHHWM30D3H82UNVWQHKSMMVD3HHWAM9V4JR2VGFGQJWT,,,,
including interest-based loans,,,,
instead of Alice sending the proof of deposit to Bob they create a multisig sharing the proof. For Statechains the proof is turned into a statecoin. The proof basically takes the place of a regular transaction not tying it to any one UTXO.,,,,
instead of like the previous link that more so tries to use imagery to better relay the message: [https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bitcoin-fixes-the-modern-fiat-ponzi-scheme-2021-09-14](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bitcoin-fixes-the-modern-fiat-ponzi-scheme-2021-09-14),,,,
"is something like this possible?\"",,,,
"is there any trading platform that will lend me 1700 dollars say if I deposit 300 dollars? better if I can do margin call \"",,,,
it automatically values in dollars in my mind,,,,
it is NOT conspiracy theory: https://www.gata.org,,,,
it is never the case.,,,,
it is ridiculed. Second,,,,
it turns out that halving 24 takes the block reward from 0.00000596 BTC (or 596 sats) down past the dust limit to 298 sats,,,,
it updates the ledger with the transaction and transfers that answer to him. By looking at the transaction history,,,,
it's called shorting the market..,,,,
it's sheer luck. You have no idea when you're going to wake up and find that your AssCoin went to zero.,,,,
it’s been reluctant to reveal details,,,,
lets make this community better in the future and collectively dissuade the behaviors I'm talking about,,,,
like the first time you see immersion mining. You have to physically break it in order to send the funds. But again,,,,
longest running codebase of money,,,,
lots of people talking about never reaching below previous ATH or pre-halving lows.,,,,
many issues. Copy pasting from another comment (not mine):,,,,
many transactions between people are recorded.,,,,
money was printed with practically zero interest rate. The effective interest rate is therefore negative. Your bank account balance stays the same but the loaf of bread becomes more expensive. It's the same thing when your bank account has a negative interest rate chipping away from your saving and the loaf of bread keeping the same price.,,,,
"most/highest coin holders are institutions?\"",,,,
no attitude or bad vibes intended.,,,,
no other personal info or any other info in general.,,,,
no the only tool to connect to outside world financially,,,,
none of them have admitted their HUGE mistake,,,,

or try to get on board with FUcoin and accumulate it so we have the universe reserve currency and can buy things from other Galaxies that we need and can't produce ourselves.,,,,

that is a more than reasonable time to see some returns in BTC.,,,,
that there is new mining-tech every year and stuff gets faster ( for example the new GTX 3090 are way better than the Graphic cards in lets say 2018).,,,,
the [Pax Dollar contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0x8e870d67f660d95d5be530380d0ec0bd388289e1) is functional and active. $USDP is fully active on other exchanges.,,,,
the addition of bitcoin to the platform will not be going away for the United States eBoutique. The company partnered with BitPay to bring the functionality to this limited release,,,,
the answer to that question is that bitcoin dies often. It has fallen by 50 per cent or more at least seven other times.,,,,
the chain will be censored.,,,,
the company can [keep posting more collateral](https://coinfomania.com/microstrategy-bitcoin-margin-call-3652/) until Bitcoin **drops as low as $3562!**,,,,
the difficulty of generating more of an asset,,,,
"the government has some hard choices if it is not going to fail. It needs to do something so that the \"\"black market\"\" is legalized and taxable",,,,
the most interesting thing about bitcoin is the price in USD. Thus you are either dirty speculator,,,,
the relative size of the financial sector would return to that last seen during the gold standard (less than 5% of GDP)…,,,,
the wordcel debt scam market has to Darwinian self select out of the economic gene pool. You are seeing evolution unfold in real time,,,,
then it is just more user friendly,,,,
then stay brainwashed sheep and good luck with that cuz I will get this out eventually and the entire thing is going to fall. Here's a video https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/va36st/here_is_a_video_that_is_relevant_to_my_last_post/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share,,,,

"we were in uncharted territory due to the amount of institutional investors in crypto. \"\"We will not have 90% corrections anymore. Crypto has matured. There are too many big players involved for it to happen.\"\" And yet even though we continiously enter uncharted territory we always seem to fall back into the same 4- year-cycle.",,,,
we will have a recession. If rates don’t go up we will have a depression.,,,,
we would love to bolster our efforts in this regard and start answering more and more questions from the retail community. We value your continued support and want all shareholders to feel confident in their investment.,,,,
"well there's a long list of things to get banned too I guess.\"",,,,
well where did they get the money from? Well,or when they do spend money they want to spend it on things that are going to last a long time.,,,
we’ll recover from that. Today I want to show you my new project. After 8 months of development it’s finally finished. The past years I’ve learning programming and I wanted to apply some of the stuff that I learnt to Bitcoin. So,,,,
what chances are that the population will abandon Bitcoin in favor of this new currency,,,,
what do you think about this Idea?,,,,
where they can in turn lend to someone else. Other than that,,,,
