no one controls inflation because there is none. And the interest rate will be based on the international free market. We should see interest rate for Bitcoin as effective interest rate that can also be negative. Maybe the market wants the interest rate to be negative? Who knows? And that translates to an effective inflation. But that's not the end of the world. Inflation happens! And it should happen. We can't have the good without the bad.,,,,
