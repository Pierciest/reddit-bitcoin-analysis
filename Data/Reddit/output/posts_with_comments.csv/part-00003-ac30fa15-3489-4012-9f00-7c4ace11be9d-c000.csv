BTC is very low at this point hovering around 19k but that doesn’t guarantee that it will sky rocket again …it can go up or it can go down further.

While there is a possibility there’s no guarantee for any price. So take the risk what you can afford to lose. That’s it. Nothing more unless you wanna burn your fingers,,,,
